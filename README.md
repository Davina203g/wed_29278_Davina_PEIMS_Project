##  Project Overview
PEIMS is a secure and efficient Passenger Emergency Information Management System designed for bus companies.  
It records passenger identity, emergency contacts, booking details, and trip manifests.  
During accidents or emergencies, authorized personnel can quickly retrieve verified passenger information.

The system uses Oracle 21c, PL/SQL, business rules, triggers and auditing mechanisms.
